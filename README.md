# 🌌 CosmicZoom - nwHacks 2025

An immersive educational platform that combines interactive 3D visualization with AI-powered Q&A to help students explore scientific concepts by zooming from the vast observable universe down to the atomic level.

## 🏆 Hackathon Project

This project was developed for **nwHacks 2025** with the goal of creating an engaging, interactive learning experience where students can:
- Explore 3D scientific models through intuitive scroll-based navigation
- Journey from the cosmic scale down to atomic structures through seamless zooming
- Ask questions and get AI-powered explanations about the content they're viewing

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Interactive 3D Visualization
- **Scale-based Navigation**: Scroll to zoom from cosmic structures down to atomic level
- **Smooth Transitions**: Seamless movement from universe to atoms through progressive zooming
- **Real-time Rendering**: Powered by Three.js and React Three Fiber
- **Mouse Interaction**: Orbit controls for 360° exploration of 3D models

### 🧠 AI-Powered Q&A System
- **Context-Aware Assistant**: Ask questions about the currently displayed 3D model
- **OpenAI Integration**: Powered by GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent responses
- **Collapsible Interface**: Clean, non-intrusive panel design
- **Real-time Communication**: Instant responses to student inquiries

### 📚 Educational Content
The platform covers scientific concepts across multiple scales, starting from the largest and zooming into progressively smaller structures:

1. **Observable Universe** - The largest scale we can observe
2. **Milky Way Galaxy** - Our home galaxy with billions of stars
3. **Solar System** - Celestial mechanics and planetary relationships
4. **Earth** - Our planet and its characteristics
5. **Biological Systems** - Living organisms (Beaver model)
6. **DNA Helix** - Genetic information storage
7. **Molecular Structure** - DNA bases and molecular interactions  
8. **Atomic Level** - Basic building blocks of matter

   node server.js
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001

## 🎮 How to Use

### Navigation
- **Scroll Up/Down**: Zoom in/out on current model
- **Automatic Transitions**: Reach zoom limits to transition between scales
- **Mouse Controls**: Click and drag to rotate 3D models
- **Orbit View**: Explore models from all angles

### AI Assistant
1. Click **"Ask a Question"** button in the bottom-right corner
2. Type your question about the current 3D model or scientific concept
3. Click **"Ask"** to get an AI-powered response
4. Close the panel with the **"X"** button when done

### Educational Journey
Start from the **Observable Universe** and scroll to zoom in, triggering automatic transitions through:
Universe → Galaxy → Solar System → Earth → Biology → DNA → Molecule → Atom
